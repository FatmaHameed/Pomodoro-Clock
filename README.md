# Pomodoro Clock

Pomodoro Clock is an application built as part of assignment to Hack Your Future coding school. 
In this app, I used javascript language for coding. 

This project is estimating the time (default as 25:00 min.) that a worker should plan for his/her work before he/she takes a short break between this time. It beneficial to avoid health problems of sitting and working for long hours without taking breaks in between.

The project is working by sitting the time needed for work, then press the play button. After the set time is finished, the message comes with (time is up), so it is the time for break. The time can be paused by pressing pause button and can be reset as well
